Created a React App for URL shortener

1. Frontend is build using reactJS.
2. For Backend used Google Firebase.

* App which takes a form input
1. Long URL (Should be a valid URL
2. Short Link (Should be a valid URL)
3. A button to convert it to a shorter link.

Algorithim Used:
Hashing for storing the short link in the database. Used the short link as the unique identifier for each record in the database.
Because of that we can throw an error message to provide some other short link. If the use is not providing an short link then
it is automatically transformed to a short link having an encoded id which generates alpha numeric characters following 64 bit standard.
